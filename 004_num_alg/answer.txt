Input: a non-negative integer N
Output: a sequences list which contains the generated numbers from this algorithm

1: We initialize an empty list to save the sequences later
2: Calculate the starting value, which is 3N in this problem
3: Add the starting value in the sequences list
4: Continue adding numbers by incrementing the last number in the sequences list by 2 each time
5: Repeat the step 4 until the sequences list has (2*N+2) numbers
6: Output the final sequences list
