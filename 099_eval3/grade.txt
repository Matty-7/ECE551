Running your test cases
-------------------------
 This test case will run 
 ships-step1 
 With arguments 
 inputs/ships0.txt 
-------------------------
I need to compile your code for ships-step1 (make ships-step1)

Compiling ships-step1
g++ -c -Wall -Werror -ggdb3 -pedantic --std=gnu++03 CargoManager.cpp
g++ -c -Wall -Werror -ggdb3 -pedantic --std=gnu++03 ShipManager.cpp
g++ -o ships-step1 -Wall -Werror -ggdb3 -pedantic --std=gnu++03 step1.cpp CargoManager.o ShipManager.o
rm CargoManager.o ShipManager.o

You have already pass the basic tests for step1:
**step1 basic tests passed for jh730 at 1731869741** : f44860fe43f741f323e57be3ddc51a47cef44abc  -
You have PASSED all of your test cases
Keep adding test cases until you are satisfied your program is correct
